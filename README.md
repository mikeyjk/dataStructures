Some datastructures for the purposes of learning Test Driven Development.
Starting with a binary tree, using google unit testing.
In TDD you are meant to write the tests then write the code, I didn't do this for the BTree, because it took me ages to work out how to link against the gtest library.

Have now switched to clang.
Google unit test can be a bit of a pain to link, but it is all working.. (for now).
